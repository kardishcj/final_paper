# final_paper

The final outputs of this projec are final_project.pdf and index.html. final_product.pdf is the academic paper version of a logistic regression comparing the impact of a number of explanatory variables on the likelihood of voting across four different generations. index.html is the website version. The files that produced these final outputs are final_product.Rmd and index.Rmd.

The data used is contained in anes_timeseries_2012_Stata12.dta.

The script that was used to clean and prepare the above data is cleaning_final.R. This script is dynamically linked via the "source" function to both final products. 

final_paper.bib contains the bibliography that is used in final_product.pdf. 

presentation_R.Rmd is an earlier presentation of results which also served as the foundation of the website, index.html. 

final_gof.Rmd, final_results.Rmd, and final_predictions.Rmd are all scripts that fed into final_project.pdf. They are simply the subsections, which were separate files to avoid merge conflicts within final_project.Rmd during the work.
